## 📝 About the Project  
This project focuses on **Exploratory Data Analysis (EDA)** of historical COVID-19 data in the U.S., using a public API that recorded data until 2021. The goal is to clean, analyze, and visualize the data to extract meaningful insights.  

The project is divided into two parts:  
1. **Individual Analysis:** Each participant conducts an independent EDA and documents their findings.  
2. **Group Analysis:** Teams consolidate their individual work into a final report and presentation.
